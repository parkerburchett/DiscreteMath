TimeCompletity of my version of the toitent function


for E(0,n) gets the toit for every int below.

requires 

time cost
E(n)

do n gcd(k) calls where k = all integers between 0 and n.

E(n) = gcd(1,n) + gcd(2,n) + ... gcd(n-1,n) + gcdn(n,n)


time cost of gcd(a,b)

min(a | b) * constant time operations. 

therefore gcd(1) is a single constant time operation

THEREFORE

E(n) = gcd(1,n) + gcd(2,n) + ... gcd(n-1,n) + gcdn(n,n)


E(n) = 1C + 2C + ... N-1*C + NC


I am not certain of this but i think the time compleity is n^2 or n^n
