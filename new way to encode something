Cool idea

Write a script to equalize the distrbution of letters in a message

the put them randomingly interspeced (every 12 lettters for example) into a new file. That is the message.

that way it looks random.

There are 2 keys the fuction that shows what characters matter. The function that decodes the hidden message
